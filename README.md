This project introduces a deep learning model combined with Explainable AI (XAI) to classify skin burns into four categories: First-degree burns, Second-degree burns, Third-degree burns, and Healthy skin. The main goal is to ensure interpretability and transparency in predictions, which is critical for clinical decision-making.Skin burn injuries require accurate and reliable classification for effective medical intervention. While deep learning models achieve high performance, their "black-box" nature limits adoption in healthcare. This project addresses this issue by integrating Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), enabling users to visualize and understand the model's decision-making process.
